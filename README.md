# Movie Store App

This is a simple React web application that uses a public movie API to allow users to search for movies, add them to their favorites, manage a shopping cart, and simulate placing an order.

## Features

- **Search Movies**  
  Search for movies using a publicly available API.

- **Favorites**  
  Add movies to your favorites list and view them in a dedicated section.

- **Shopping Cart**  
  Add movies to a shopping cart and review your selection.

- **Checkout Process**  
  Go through a multi-step checkout process with shipping and payment steps. The final "place order" step is a dummy and does not send real data.

## Demo Functionality

This project is for demonstration purposes only. The checkout process simulates placing an order but does **not** actually submit any real data or interact with a backend.

## Technologies Used

- React
- React Router
- Context API for state management
- CSS for styling
